# Apache Beam Pipeline

This is an Apache Beam pipeline that processes transactions data to filter and summarize transactions based on specific criteria.

## Overview

The Apache Beam pipeline reads transaction data from a CSV file, applies filters and transformations, and writes the processed data to a JSONL file. The pipeline uses Apache Beam's data processing capabilities and can be run on various execution engines, such as Apache Flink, Apache Spark, or Google Cloud Dataflow.

The pipeline performs the following steps:

1. Reads the transaction data from a CSV file.
2. Filters and maps the transactions to key-value pairs based on certain criteria.
3. Combines the transactions by date and calculates the sum of transaction amounts.
4. Formats the output as JSON objects.
5. Writes the JSON objects to a compressed JSONL (JSON Lines) file.

## Use Case

This Apache Beam pipeline can be leveraged for efficient data processing in cases where large volumes of transaction data need to be filtered, aggregated, and summarized. It can be applied in areas like retail sales analysis, financial transaction monitoring, and IoT data processing. The pipeline's ability to output to a JSONL file makes the resulting data convenient for subsequent analysis, machine learning, and visualization.

Here are some simplified scenarios where Apache Beam streaming pipelines can be put to use:

1. **Real-Time Fraud Detection:** Detect fraudulent activities in financial transactions as they occur.
2. **Live Social Media Analysis:** Monitor and analyze social media posts or comments in real-time, identifying trending topics or real-time sentiment about a brand or product.
3. **E-commerce Personalization:** Keep track of a user's live activity on an e-commerce platform, updating product recommendations based on their activity.
4. **Health Monitoring:** Process live data from wearable devices, sending alerts to healthcare providers on critical changes in a patient's health status.
5. **Traffic Monitoring:** Analyze real-time data from GPS and traffic systems, providing live traffic updates and suggestions for re-routing to drivers.
6. **Network Security:** Monitor network traffic in real-time to identify potential security threats or breaches.
7. **Supply Chain Management:** Oversee live data from various points in a supply chain, assisting in identifying and addressing potential issues quickly.
8. **Customer Support:** Evaluate incoming customer support requests in real-time, helping to prioritize and assign them effectively.
9. **Smart Homes:** Process live data from various devices and sensors in a smart home, automating tasks and improving efficiency.
10. **Live Event Analysis:** Examine data from live events such as sports games or concerts, providing real-time stats, updates, or insights to viewers and commentators.


## Prerequisites

To run the pipeline, you need the following:

- Python 3.7 or above
- Apache Beam (Python SDK)
- Apache Beam dependencies (e.g., `apache-beam[gcp]` for running on Google Cloud Dataflow)
- Apache Beam runners compatible with your execution environment (e.g., Apache Flink, Apache Spark, or Google Cloud Dataflow)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>

1. Run the pipeline using the run.bat script:
